AjaxAnywhere
============

This project is a fork of the original AjaxAnywhere project (http://ajaxanywhere.sourceforge.net/) whose aims are:
- Simplify codebase
- Use jQuery to implement the required scripts 
- Avoid the need to the developer to write any javascript to apply AjaxAnywhere to any component of the page 
- Remove JSF support 
- Remove dependency with Java SE HTML parser
