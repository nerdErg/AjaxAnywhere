[AjaxAnywhere](http://www.ajaxanywhere.com) (Reloaded)
============

AjaxAnywhere is a Java Ajax framework that enables the developer to **add Ajax behavior to your web application without any Javascript coding**.

This project is a fork of the original AjaxAnywhere project (http://ajaxanywhere.sourceforge.net/) whose aims are:
- Simplify codebase
- Use jQuery to implement the required scripts 
- Avoid the need to the developer to write any javascript to apply AjaxAnywhere to any component of the page 
- Remove JSF support 
- Remove dependency with Java SE HTML parser

You can find more info about it in [our WIKI](http://nerderg.com/AjaxAnywhere).
